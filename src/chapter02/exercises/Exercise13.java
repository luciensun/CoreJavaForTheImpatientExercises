/**
 * 13. Download the JAR file for OpenCSV from http://opencsv.sourceforge.net. 
 * Write a class with a main method that reads a CSV file of your choice and prints some of the content. 
 * There is sample code on the OpenCSV web site. You havenâ€™t yet learned to deal with exceptions. 
 * Just use the following header for the main method:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
The point of this exercise is not to do anything useful with CSV files, 
but to practice using a library that is delivered as a JAR file.
